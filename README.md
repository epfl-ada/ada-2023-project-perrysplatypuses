# Title
## Abstract: 

In our daily lives, we naturally categorize everything we encounter, including the characters in the movies we love. Our goal is to employ a data-driven approach to find clusters of movie characters or archetypes. By using these archetypes, we aim to uncover valuable insights into people's preferences for character traits. Using this knowledge, we can not only help movie creators but also look into the prevailing cultural, social, and psychological dynamics.

## Research Questions: 
- Which clusters can we obtain from the plots of the movies?
- Should actors stick to only one archetype, or should they try to switch archetypes frequently in order to be successful?
- Which combinations of archetypes in the film would appeal to the audience? How does it depend on the genre
- Is there a difference in prefered archetypes based on the country of production?
- What are the historical trends?

## Proposed additional datasets (if any): 
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that youâ€™ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

## Methods
1) Clustering the data
2) Linear regression
3) Hypothesis testing

    In order to compare the success of the actors who play characters of different archetypes we use hypothesis testing in order to determine if there is statistical difference in the succes metric between groups of actors.

## Proposed timeline
