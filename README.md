## Abstract: 
A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
## Research Questions: 
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
## Proposed additional datasets (if any): 
List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
## Methods
## Proposed timeline
1) Extract characters attributes from plots
    - (Maybe, we can also do something else here?)
    - Extract character names
    - Add verbs for which a character is a subject or the object
    - Add adjectives related to a character
2) Cluster the characters based on attributes
    - calculate distance ([useful post about set clustering](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/510793/sets-clustering))
2) Perform analysis
## Organization within the team: A list of internal milestones up until project Milestone P3.
## Questions for TAs (optional): Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
