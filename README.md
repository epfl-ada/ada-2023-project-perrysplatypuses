# Title
## Abstract: 

In our daily lives, we naturally categorize everything we encounter, including the characters in the movies we love. The goal of this project is to employ a data-driven approach to find clusters of movie characters or archetypes. By using these archetypes, we aim to uncover valuable insights into people's preferences for character traits. Using this knowledge, we can not only help movie creators but also look into the prevailing cultural, social, and psychological dynamics.

## Research Questions: 
- Which actors are more succesfull: those who stick to only one archetype, or those who switch archetypes frequently?
- Which combinations of archetypes in the film appeal to the audience? How does it depend on the genre of the film?
- Is there a difference in prefered archetypes based on the country of production?
- What are the historical trends in preffered archetypes?

## Proposed additional datasets: 
[World Bank CPI](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?end=2012&start=1990&view=chart) - we will use this dataset to account for inflation and be able to fairly compare the revenues form different years
[IMDB Movies](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/) - we will use this dataset to add movies rating to the succes measure of the film and possibly to extracting additional data about the actors.

## Methods
1) Clustering the data
2) Linear regression
3) Hypothesis testing

    In order to compare the success of the actors who play characters of different archetypes we use hypothesis testing in order to determine if there is statistical difference in the succes metric between groups of actors.

## Proposed timeline
